A bird game, such as Flappy Bird, is a simple yet addictive side-scrolling arcade game where a player controls a bird attempting to fly between sets of pipes without colliding with them. The core concept revolves around timing and precision.

The player controls a bird that automatically falls due to gravity. By tapping or clicking, the player makes the bird "flap" and gain upward momentum. The screen scrolls horizontally at a steady pace, bringing a series of pipe obstacles toward the bird.

Each pipe set consists of a top and bottom pipe with a gap in between. The player must guide the bird through these gaps. If the bird touches a pipe or the ground (or flies too high), the game ends. Successfully flying through a gap scores a point.

The physics are simple: the bird's vertical position changes due to gravity and flapping. Gravity constantly pulls the bird downward. When the player taps, an upward velocity is added to the bird. This creates a flapping motion that must be timed carefully.
